        <p>…</p>
        
        <p>If we want to spread the knowledge contained in the exhibition and traditionally gathered in paper catalogues, we have to rethink the codex/monograph monopoly. This does not mean we want to do away with it, but rather that we want to come up with complementary objects and strategies, including digital ones.</p>

        <p>The linearity and graphically rich nature of the catalogue is hard to translate in most digital formats, already if only thinking about file sizes. What we would like to do is to explode the (traditional conception of the) catalogue, look at the various components that make up the book and re-combine them in a hybrid—paper and digital—ecosystem.</p>

        <p>Different pieces of content might be able to function in different contexts. It would be possible to reach various audiences and establish different relations through re-publishing different types of content in the most fitting channel—these decisions are of course made in collaboration with the social media & digital strategists.</p>

        <p>The question is then: what contents make up the universe of the publication but did finally not make it into a printed edition, due to an economy of space for example. Which texts could have been written, which images could have been produced, but did not fit into the model of the book?</p>

        <p>These questions are too late to ask in the context of an already finished publication but can be taken into account for newer projects. To have, for example, the exhibition’s curator publish a blog documenting the development of the exhibition and the catalogue, is a way to create ‘web-only’ content that enriches and is complementary to both the catalogue and the exhibition. If we look at an exhibition as a constellation of people and art works coming together, creating a certain knowledge, this is another way yet of capturing and dissemenating this knowledge.</p>

        <p>Thus, the proposition rethinks the traditional process of making publications, think of it as identifying and creating a collection of objects (texts and images), and describing their relations. The editorial process first focusses on elaborating the selection and the relations between the objects, then identify formats that can be used to make it public.</p>
        
        <h2>Workflows</h2>
        
        <p>The following schema proposes a workflow for the upcoming publication (and the past publications), in which the paper publication is still the main source (last version stored in the INDD file after last proofreading).</p>
        
        <img src="/hybrid-workflow-next.svg">
        <p>The second step, for the next publications, is to consider the publication as a collection of multimedia contents: the different elements to be published by the Fotomuseum (images, legends, texts, videos) are selected and created, and the relations between these elements are described. In a period of transition, the elaboration and the design of the paper version and the digital ones are still quite separated.</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <img src="/hybrid-workflow-future.svg">
        
        <p>For further publications, The aim is to reach a more global hybrid publishing strategy, that will give a greater coherence between all the formats, and more complementarity.</p>
        
        <h2>Hybrid publication designer</h2>
        <p>In this workflow, a new and central position appears, that of a hybrid art director/graphic designer who will take care of the publication strategy as a whole, and work on the coherence between all the formats chosen.</p>
        <p>…</p>
        
        
        <h2>HTML as a basis</h2>
        
        <p style="text-align: center"><img src="/hybrid-HTML-schema.svg"></p>
        
        <p>Going in the sense of the new digital strategy of the Fotomuseum, this new workflow puts the HTML format and the web database at the center of the publishing strategy. The HTML content becomes the source for all the materials, that are stored in a database with a versionning system, can be modified online through an editing interface (CMS), and then used in the different outputs.</p>
        <p>This system answers the very practical question of the “after-design” proofreading modifications, problematic in every publication process: how to integrate the corrections in the design easily and safely? Where is the last version stored, and is it easily re-usable? Particularily in the context of hybrid (and efficient) publishing, a single source is essential. One source to rely on, and on which all the outputs can be based.</p>
        <p>Versionning systems were developed in the context of programing culture, to keep trace of the modifications on a code file. These systems improve collaborative workflows, and make it easier to follow the changes in a file.</p>
        <p>Transposed in a print-layout/graphic design context, the graphic designer could import all the datas again, in the layout file with the risk of loosing layout detail’s adjustments, or choose to add only the modifications, which are very easily identified with a versionning system…</p>
        
        <h2>Open licenses</h2>
        <p>The future will be hybrid and multi-formats. Which doesn’t make things easy in terms of licencing. But the future will also hopefully be open. Encouraging the contributors to publish their texts, pictures and videos with an open license will facilitate their re-use in multi-format publishing and allow for more flexibility, for example with new formats that we don’t even know yet.</p>

        <p>For instance, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons license “Attribution-ShareAlike”</a> or “CC BY-SA” allows the re-use of the work for any purpose and through any media, as long as the new use credits the author and license the new creations under the identical terms.</p>

        <p>These open licenses also enables re-use for educational purposes.</p>
        <p>…</p>
        
        <h2>Modules and combinations</h2>
        <p>“For the text to make any sense at all post-scramble, it had to be ‘prepared,’ like pieces of lego, each already designed to fit together with other pieces in multiple ways,” says Umberto Eco on <i>Tristano</i>, a combinatory algorithmically generated novel written/programmed by Nanni Balestrini in 1966, of which Verso re-published 10,000 different versions (out of the 109,027,350,432,000 possible variations) in 2014.</p>
        <p>Thinking the publication as a collection of contents interrelated allows more flexibility and modularity. It also enables potential future re-use of the information in another context. For example, a contributor could look for a picture in the Fotomuseum database and see in which previous publications it appeared, and maybe read a contextualised extract in which the picture is mentionned. This would also be an interesting feature for the public and educational purposes: being able to visualize a network around each work and understand its connections.</p>
        
        <h2>The library of babel</h2>
        <p>The aim of this workflow is to expand the possibilities of publication formats, and include them in a general strategy, to not have to re-invent the wheel at every publication. But all the formats won’t be necessary every time and that is where the work of the editor(s) is very important: choosing among the possibilities the ones that will make sense in relation to the content, and regarding each other.</p>
        
        <h2>Public reception – a hybrid reader?</h2>
        <p>As N.Katherine Hayles says, in her text <i>Electronic Literature: What is it?</i> (2007), “readers come to digital work with expectations formed by print, including extensive and deep tacit knowledge of letter forms, print conventions, and print literary modes. Of necessity, [we] must build on these expectations even as it modifies and transforms them.”</p>
        <p>A printed publication, an ePub and a web publication can have very different cultural values and different uses for different publics. A big coffee-table catalogue with great reproductions will be acquired as a collection item, important for the artist and the institution to mark their presence in the landscape of art (libraries), and as a “legitimation” object. If it contains good texts by art historians and critics, it will as well touch a public of art-intellectuals peers. An interactive website providing tools to dive in the published content, zooms, vidéos, comments on details, etc, might not interest that much the collectors but be of great interest for education purposes. Of course, this categorization has limits and exceptions, but at first sight the identification of the publication object will be determinatory. The visual codes play a lot in this process of identification.</p>
        <p>If all the contemporary formats of publication are very different, they are not incompatible. They are rather complementary, and a good hybrid publishing strategy can be efficient public-wise, both in terms of quantity (bigger public, more varied) and quality (one person can be interested in several formats responding to different needs and uses she/he has). </p>
        <p>It builds connections.</p>
