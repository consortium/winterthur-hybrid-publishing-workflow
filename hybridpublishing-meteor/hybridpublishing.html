        <h1>The Museum Catalogue in Post-digital Times</h1>
        <p>Within the world of art publishing, the catalogues produced by Fotomuseum Winterthur have acquired a solid reputation. Working with designers such as *,*,* and publishers like *,*,*, and commissions new texts for each catalogue. These books make sure that exhibitions staged at Winterthur reach a larger audience than its rather remote geographical location would otherwise suggest.</p>

        <p>Created to high standards of print design and reproduction quality, the catalogues are prime examples of the monograph. The firm commitment to the printed object also come with a down-side. The excellent, yet medium specific objects, are hard to translate to the digital domain. With the public discourse around art taking place in large parts online, there are a myriad of web channels not yet exploited by the Fotomuseum.</p>

        <p>Fotomuseum has asked The Hybrid Publishing Consortium to conduct an investigation in how their publishing tradition can be re-imagined in the context of digital publishing. The Hybrid Publishing asked designers Loraine Furter and Eric Schrijver to be involved in this.</p>

        <p>This publishing research case study will focus on one particular publication and exhibition—Manifeste! Eine andere Geschichte der Fotografie (Fotomuseum Winterthur, 13 September to 23 November 2014).</p>

        <section data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Exploding the Codex</h2>

        <p>If we want to spread the knowledge contained in the exhibition and traditionally gathered in paper catalogues, we have to rethink the codex/monograph monopoly. This does not mean we want to do away with it, but rather that we want to come up with complementary objects and strategies, including digital ones.</p>

        <p>The linearity and graphically rich nature of the catalogue is hard to translate in most digital formats, already if only thinking about file sizes. What we would like to do is to explode the (traditional conception of the) catalogue, look at the various components that make up the book and re-combine them in a hybrid—paper and digital—ecosystem.</p>

        <p>Books from the post-Gutenberg era and digital publishing can easily be opposed. In this logic, the codex is demarcated and linear, whereas digital publishing is fragmented, interlinked and embraces the logic of the databases: elements have formal relations but no inherent narrative order.</p>

        <p>Upon closer scrutiny, the opposition does not really hold: many elements of the codex return in digital publishing models. The Institute of Network Cultures provides a useful overview of the various digital publishing formats in their publication <a href="http://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/from-print-to-ebooks-a-hybrid-publishing-toolkit-for-the-arts/">‘From Print to Ebooks: a Hybrid Publishing Toolkit for the Arts’</a>.</p>
        <p>The following graphic plots the most popular ones: </p>

        <p style="text-align: center"><img src="dptk_05_1_rich_poor.svg" /><br/>Image: Medamo and Kimmy Spreeuwenberg, p. 31. CC NC BY<br/><br/></p>
        <p>The y-axis shows types of navigation ranging from standard (meaning, in this case, lineair) to customised. The x-axis shows layout from plain to rich. It is not an accident that the option with the richest layout also has a very lineair navigation. A format like PDF is a page description language: the position of every element is described very carefully. Most other digital publishing formats are based on mark-up languages like HTML: these provide a description of the content that leave a lot more interpretation to the device that finally is going to display it.</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Different pieces of content might be able to function in different contexts. It would be possible to reach various audiences and establish different relations through re-publishing different types of content in the most fitting channel—these decisions are of course made in collaboration with the social media & digital strategists.</p>

        <p>The question is then: what contents make up the universe of the publication but did finally not make it into a printed edition, due to an economy of space for example. Which texts could have been written, which images could have been produced, but did not fit into the model of the book?</p>

        <p>These questions are too late to ask in the context of an already finished publication but can be taken into account for newer projects. To have, for example, the exhibition’s curator publish a blog documenting the development of the exhibition and the catalogue, is a way to create ‘web-only’ content that enriches and is complementary to both the catalogue and the exhibition. If we look at an exhibition as a constellation of people and art works coming together, creating a certain knowledge, this is another way yet of capturing and dissemenating this knowledge.</p>

        <p>Thus, the proposition rethinks the traditional process of making publications, think of it as identifying and creating a collection of objects (texts and images), and describing their relations. The editorial process first focusses on elaborating the selection and the relations between the objects, then identify formats that can be used to make it public.</p>

        <h1>Exploding Manifeste</h1>

        <p>Manifeste! is the first exhibition to explore the historical relationship between photography and the manifesto, collecting together statements from across the history of photography. The publication focuses on practitioners who ‘repeatedly voiced their opinions about the use and perception, as well as the vision and pitfalls of photography’. Manifeste! provides a new perspective on photography and formulates an alternative history of the medium.</p>

        <h2>Workflows</h2>

        <p>The following schema proposes a workflow for the upcoming publication (and the past publications), in which the paper publication is still the main source (last version stored in the INDD file after last proofreading).</p>

        <p style="text-align: center"><img src="hybrid-workflow-before.svg" /></p>

        <p>The way in which the Winterthur catalogues have been produced is similar to how many smaller art publishers work. The visual design is very important: the relation between form and content is tight. In the case of museum Winterthur, there is no fixed house style—they even work with multiple designers.</p>
        <p>The museum, in this sense, works without templates. This does not mean that no optimisation at all is possible: programs like inDesign permit to hook into external Content Management Systems, through the generic exchange technology of XML. This is what larger publishers do—they build custom workflows to enable the sharing of elements between various formats of publications. But because art publishers require both more customisation  and have smaller IT budgets, such solutions are hardly ever put in place.</p>
        <p>The practical consequence of this workflow, is that all of the knowledge that is produced during the production of the catalogue becomes encoded into one file, the inDesign file. Not only the visual design is stored in this file, also the canonical versions of the texts: since the proofs are created from inDesign, any corrections are often encoded with this program as well.</p>
        <p>Because the inDesign is the digital representation of the knowledge represented by the catalogue, the Consortium wanted to find out how much of this knowledge could be extracted from the file, in order to be able to re-use it in other, digital, publishing contexts.</p>

        <section data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Le-tex and Transpect</h2>
        <p>The Consortium has build up a working relation with the Leipzig based company le-tex. Le-tex specialises in what they call ‘Content Engineering’. Basically, they come up with workflows for publishers for all parts of the process leading up to the publication. This means importing text formats into Content Management Systems, formally verifying them and allowing for proof-reading, version management and conversion strategies between the various digital and analog formats in use.</p>
        <p>What is exciting about le-tex, besides their extensive experience, is the fact that they have Open Sourced a large part of their digital solutions. Transpect is an ‘open source framework for converting and checking documents’. Our close working relationship and the fact that their tools are Open Source makes us confident in suggesting le-tex’s tools as part of a hybrid publishing workflow.</p>
        <p>What is special about Transpect specifically is the way in which it handles lay-out and styling information. Content Management Systems have a tendency to focus on the encoding and exchange of text, leaving styling to ephemeral templates. Transpect takes it upon itself to also translate the various forms in which layout and style can be encoded. Most importantly, it provides facilities for converting inDesign paragraph styles to CSS styles and vice versa.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-type="sect2">
        <h2>From InDesign to HTML</h2>
        <p>The usual workflow with Transpect is to set up a ‘conversion pipeline’ from one format to another. This pipeline is then configured and tweaked to best accomodate the specificities of the input. For our experiment with the Manifeste catalogue, we first opted to convert the inDesign file to HTML. We chose HTML because it is the lingua franca of digital publishing: it is used both on websites and eBooks, and increasingly in mobile applications. It is easy to store and repurpose.</p>
        <p>The caveat mentioned for art publishers becomes apparent again. While we experimented with converting the inDesign file of the Manifeste catalogue, we found ourselves adapting the pipeline to the specificities of the publication. Letex’s Gerrit Imsieke also came up with a number of changes we could make to the inDesign file itself.</p>
        <p>Gerrit also provided a series of guidelines for designers working in inDesign, that make their files easier to process (we added these as an annex). We suggest that Winterthur asks the designers for upcoming catalogues to follow them.</p>
        <p>The recommendations will make the process of extracting content easier—but it is probable that every single publication will still require a certain amount of customisation.</p>


        <img src="hybrid-workflow-next.svg" />
        <p>The second step, for the next publications, is to consider the publication as a collection of multimedia contents: the different elements to be published by the Fotomuseum (images, legends, texts, videos) are selected and created, and the relations between these elements are described. In a period of transition, the elaboration and the design of the paper version and the digital ones are still quite separated.</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <img src="hybrid-workflow-future.svg" />

        <p>For further publications, The aim is to reach a more global hybrid publishing strategy, that will give a greater coherence between all the formats, and more complementarity.</p>

        <h2>Hybrid publication designer</h2>
        <p>In this workflow, a new and central position appears, that of a hybrid art director/graphic designer who will take care of the publication strategy as a whole, and work on the coherence between all the formats chosen.</p>
        <p>…</p>

        <h1>Propositions for a workflow</h1>

        <section data-type="sect2">
        <h2>HTML as a basis</h2>

        <p style="text-align: center"><img src="hybrid-HTML-schema.svg" /></p>

        <p>Going in the sense of the new digital strategy of the Fotomuseum, this new workflow puts the HTML format and the web database at the center of the publishing strategy. The HTML content becomes the source for all the materials, that are stored in a database with a versionning system, can be modified online through an editing interface (CMS), and then used in the different outputs.</p>
        <p>This system answers the very practical question of the “after-design” proofreading modifications, problematic in every publication process: how to integrate the corrections in the design easily and safely? Where is the last version stored, and is it easily re-usable? Particularily in the context of hybrid (and efficient) publishing, a single source is essential. One source to rely on, and on which all the outputs can be based.</p>
        <p>Versionning systems were developed in the context of programing culture, to keep trace of the modifications on a code file. These systems improve collaborative workflows, and make it easier to follow the changes in a file.</p>
        <p>Transposed in a print-layout/graphic design context, the graphic designer could import all the datas again, in the layout file with the risk of loosing layout detail’s adjustments, or choose to add only the modifications, which are very easily identified with a versionning system…</p>

        <section data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Open licenses</h2>
        <p>The future will be hybrid and multi-formats. Which doesn’t make things easy in terms of licencing. But the future will also hopefully be open. Encouraging the contributors to publish their texts, pictures and videos with an open license will facilitate their re-use in multi-format publishing and allow for more flexibility, for example with new formats that we don’t even know yet.</p>

        <p>For instance, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons license “Attribution-ShareAlike”</a> or “CC BY-SA” allows the re-use of the work for any purpose and through any media, as long as the new use credits the author and license the new creations under the identical terms.</p>

        <p>These open licenses also enables re-use for educational purposes.</p>
        <p>…</p>

        <section data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Modules and combinations</h2>
        <p>“For the text to make any sense at all post-scramble, it had to be ‘prepared,’ like pieces of lego, each already designed to fit together with other pieces in multiple ways,” says Umberto Eco on <i>Tristano</i>, a combinatory algorithmically generated novel written/programmed by Nanni Balestrini in 1966, of which Verso re-published 10,000 different versions (out of the 109,027,350,432,000 possible variations) in 2014.</p>
        <p>Thinking the publication as a collection of contents interrelated allows more flexibility and modularity. It also enables potential future re-use of the information in another context. For example, a contributor could look for a picture in the Fotomuseum database and see in which previous publications it appeared, and maybe read a contextualised extract in which the picture is mentionned. This would also be an interesting feature for the public and educational purposes: being able to visualize a network around each work and understand its connections.</p>

        <h2>The library of babel</h2>
        <p>The aim of this workflow is to expand the possibilities of publication formats, and include them in a general strategy, to not have to re-invent the wheel at every publication. But all the formats won’t be necessary every time and that is where the work of the editor(s) is very important: choosing among the possibilities the ones that will make sense in relation to the content, and regarding each other.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Public reception – a hybrid reader?</h2>
        <p>As N.Katherine Hayles says, in her text <i>Electronic Literature: What is it?</i> (2007), “readers come to digital work with expectations formed by print, including extensive and deep tacit knowledge of letter forms, print conventions, and print literary modes. Of necessity, [we] must build on these expectations even as it modifies and transforms them.”</p>
        <p>A printed publication, an ePub and a web publication can have very different cultural values and different uses for different publics. A big coffee-table catalogue with great reproductions will be acquired as a collection item, important for the artist and the institution to mark their presence in the landscape of art (libraries), and as a “legitimation” object. If it contains good texts by art historians and critics, it will as well touch a public of art-intellectuals peers. An interactive website providing tools to dive in the published content, zooms, vidéos, comments on details, etc, might not interest that much the collectors but be of great interest for education purposes. Of course, this categorization has limits and exceptions, but at first sight the identification of the publication object will be determinatory. The visual codes play a lot in this process of identification.</p>
        <p>If all the contemporary formats of publication are very different, they are not incompatible. They are rather complementary, and a good hybrid publishing strategy can be efficient public-wise, both in terms of quantity (bigger public, more varied) and quality (one person can be interested in several formats responding to different needs and uses she/he has). </p>
        <p>It builds connections.</p>
