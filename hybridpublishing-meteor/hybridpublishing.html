        <h1>Hybrid Publishing Workflows<br><br>Fotomuseum Winterthur<br></h1>
        <p>If we want to spread the knowledge contained in the catalogue—the exhibition in a digital fashion, we have to rethink the codex/monograph. This does not mean we want to do away with it, but rather that we want to come up with complementary objects and strategies.</p>

        <p>The linearity and graphically rich nature of the catalogue is hard to combine with most digital formats, already if only thinking about file sizes. What we would like to do is to explode the catalogue, look at the various components that make up the book.</p>

        <p>Different pieces of content might be able to function in different contexts. It should be possible to reach various audiences and establish different relations through re-publishing different types of content in the most fitting channel—these decisions are of course made in collaboration with the social media & digital strategists.</p>

        <p>Then the question is what contents make up the universe of the book but might finally not have made it into a printed edition—due to an economy of space for example. And finally—which texts could have been written, which images could have been produced, but did not fit into the model of the book?</p>

        <p>The last question obviously becomes late to ask in the context of an already finished publication but can be taken into account for newer projects. To have, for example, the exhibition’s curator publish a blog documenting the development of the exhibition and the catalogue, is a way to create ‘web-only’ content that enriches and is complementary to both the catalogue and the exhibition. If we look at an exhibition as a certain constellation of people and art works coming together and creating a certain knowledge, this is another way yet of capturing and dissemenating this knowledge.</p>

        <p>Proposition: rethink the process of making publications, think of it as identifying and creating a collection of objects (texts and images), related. The editorial process first focusses on elaborating the selection and the relations between the objects, then identify formats that could be used to make it public.</p>
        
        <img src="/hybrid-workflow-next.svg">
        <p>The second step will be to start with the organisation of the content: the different elements to be published by the Fotomuseum (images, legends, texts, videos) are created or selected, and the relations between these elements are described.</p>
        <img src="/hybrid-workflow-future.svg">
        
        <p>The aim is to reach more global hybrid publishing strategy, that will give a greater coherence between all the formats, and more complementarity.</p>
        
        <h2>Open licenses</h2>
        <p>Encouraging the contributors to release their material with an open license will facilitate the re-use of them in multi-format publishing and allow for more flexibility. </p>

        <p>For instance, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons license “Attribution-ShareAlike”</a> or “CC BY-SA” allows the re-use of the work for any purpose and through any media, as long as the new use credits the author and license the new creations under the identical terms. </p>

        <p>These open licenses also enables re-use for educational porposes.</p>
        
        <h2>HTML as a standard</h2>
        <p>Going in the sense of the new digital strategy of the Fotomuseum, this new workflow puts the html format and the web database at the center of the publishing strategy. The html content becomes the source for all the materials, that are modified online and then used for the different outputs.</p>
